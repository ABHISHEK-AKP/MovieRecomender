üß† Algorithms
1. Collaborative Filtering

User-Based CF: Recommends movies liked by similar users
Item-Based CF: Recommends movies similar to those the user liked
Matrix Factorization: Uses SVD and NMF for dimensionality reduction

2. Content-Based Filtering

TF-IDF Vectorization: Analyzes movie descriptions and genres
Cosine Similarity: Measures similarity between movie features
Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features from movie metadata

3. Hybrid Approach

Weighted Combination: Combines collaborative and content-based methods
Switching Hybrid: Chooses the best algorithm based on data availability
Mixed Recommendations: Presents results from multiple algorithms

4. Evaluation Metrics

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
